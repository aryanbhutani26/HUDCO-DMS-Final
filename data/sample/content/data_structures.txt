# Python Data Structures

Python provides several built-in data structures to store and organize data.

## Lists:
Ordered, mutable collections of items.
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
fruits.append("grape")
```

## Dictionaries:
Key-value pairs for mapping relationships.
```python
student = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 20,
    "grade": "A"
}
```

## Tuples:
Ordered, immutable collections.
```python
coordinates = (10, 20)
```

## Sets:
Unordered collections of unique items.
```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

Each data structure has specific use cases and methods for manipulation.
